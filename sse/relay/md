## Definitions


## Requirements

### `rel=http://grimwire.com/rel/sse/relay` Resource Behaviors

- MUST implement the 'GET' method for Accept=text/event-stream which:
 - MUST play back message history when the 'Last-Event-Id' header is present
 - MUST play back all available history when 'Last-Event-Id' header is set to -1
- MUST implement the 'NOTIFY' method to:
 - broadcast an event which MUST be defined as:
 <pre>
 event: &lt;NOTIFY sender id&gt;
 data: &lt;NOTIFY request body&gt;
 </pre>
 - broadcast the event to all users other than the 'NOTIFY' sender


## Comments

This spec was originally created for a WebRTC signaling resource. The relay resource should provide additional tools for verifying sender ids, controlling who can listen, etc, as applicable.
